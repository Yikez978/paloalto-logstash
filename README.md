Logstash patterns and config for PaloAlto Networks firewall logs 

There are patterns for:

  * Generic logs (PALOALTO)
  * CONFIG logs (PALOALTOCONFIG)
  * SYSTEM logs (PALOALTOSYSTEM)
  * THREAT logs (PALOALTOTHREAT)

Notice that several fields are not captured because I don't know what they
represent.
